# TSP

This was an algorithms project meant to analyze the efficiency and runtimes of two different implementations of the Traveling Salesperson Problem.

We were meant to implement the "Nearest Neighbors" approach, as well as an "Exhaustive Search" in order to get an answer to the Traveling Salesperson Problem, as
well as record the runtimes of each of both of these implementations on randomly generated inputs we created.
